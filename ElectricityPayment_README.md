Title: Paying Electricity Bill Using Bkash App
Objective: To verify if the Bkash app is able to successfully process payment of electricity bills.
From the test case we expected that the Bkash app should successfully process the payment of the electricity bill, and the payment should be reflected in both the 
Bkash app and the electricity bill portal.
Note: This test case should be repeated for each different electricity bill payment made using the Bkash app.
